          <h2>Spinosaurus</h2>
          <img src="Bilder/spinosaur.png" alt="Spinosaurus">
        </div>
        <p>
          The Spinosaurus in Ark: Survival Evolved is a large, semi-aquatic
          predator that roams rivers and lakes. Highly aggressive and dangerous,
          it rivals the Rex in raw power but stands out for its speed and
          adaptability both on land and in water. When submerged, the Spino
          gains a boost to movement and attack strength, making it especially
          lethal in aquatic environments.<br />Taming a Spino requires
          tranquilizers and a steady supply of prime meat or kibble. Though
          challenging, the reward is a highly versatile mount. The Spino can
          switch between quadrupedal stance for faster mobility and bipedal
          stance for stronger attacks, allowing survivors to adapt to different
          combat situations with ease.<br />Because of its unique balance of
          power, speed, and adaptability, the Spinosaurus is a favorite among
          survivors for exploration, combat, and survival across diverse
          terrains.<br />

        </div>
        <p>
          The Tyrannosaurus Rex in Ark: Survival Evolved is one of the most
          iconic and fearsome predators on the island. Found roaming plains,
          forests, and mountains, the Rex is a highly aggressive carnivore that
          dominates its surroundings with raw power and massive size. Its roar
          and presence make it a constant threat to both survivors and wild
          creatures.<br />Taming a Rex requires tranquilizers and a steady
          supply of prime meat or kibble. While the process can be dangerous due
          to its strength and aggression, a successfully tamed Rex becomes a
          powerful ally. Its incredible damage output, high health, and
          intimidating roar make it a staple for large-scale battles and boss
          fights.<br />The Rex is prized by survivors as one of the best war
          mounts in the game. With its unmatched combat abilities and
          durability, it is commonly used in raids, boss encounters, and for
          defending bases. Its sheer dominance ensures that it remains a top
          choice for players seeking strength and reliability.<br />

        </div>
        <p>
          The Raptor in Ark: Survival Evolved is a small but highly agile and
          intelligent predator. Found in packs across various biomes, Raptors
          are known for their speed, cunning, and pack hunting tactics. They are
          less powerful than larger predators but make up for it with their
          ability to quickly close distances and overwhelm prey through
          coordinated attacks.<br />Taming a Raptor requires tranquilizers and a
          supply of meat or kibble. While they are easier to tame compared to
          larger dinosaurs, their pack behavior means that taming one may
          attract others, leading to potentially dangerous situations. Once
          tamed, Raptors become fast and nimble mounts, ideal for scouting and
          quick strikes.<br />Raptors are favored by survivors for their speed
          and agility. They excel in hit-and-run tactics and can navigate
          difficult terrain with ease. Their pack mentality also allows them to
          be effective in group combat scenarios, making them valuable
          companions for both exploration and battle.<br />

          <img src="Bilder/dodo.png" alt="Dodo">
        </div>
        <p>
          The Dodo in Ark: Survival Evolved is a harmless, flightless bird that
          roams beaches and grassy areas. Unlike most creatures on the island,
          the Dodo poses no threat to survivors and is often one of the first
          animals encountered by new players. Its small size and slow movement
          make it an easy target for hunting or taming.<br />Taming a Dodo is
          very simple, requiring only a few berries or other basic foods.
          Because of this, many survivors tame them early in the game for
          practice or as a light source of eggs and meat. They can also be bred
          quickly, providing a reliable source of Dodo Eggs for crafting
          kibble.<br />While not useful in combat, the Dodo has a charm of its
          own. Survivors often keep them as pets, egg producers, or even as part
          of amusing base defenses by breeding large flocks. Despite its lack of
          strength, the Dodo has earned a place as one of the most recognizable
          and beloved creatures in the game.<br />

        </div>
        <p>
          The Ankylosaurus in Ark: Survival Evolved is a heavily armored
          herbivore known for its distinctive clubbed tail and robust body.
          Found in various biomes, including forests and plains, the
          Ankylosaurus is a peaceful creature that primarily feeds on plants.
          Its thick armor provides excellent protection against predators,
          making it a reliable companion for survivors.<br />Taming an
          Ankylosaurus requires tranquilizers and a supply of vegetables or
          kibble. Once tamed, it becomes an invaluable asset for resource
          gathering, particularly for harvesting metal, stone, and other hard
          materials due to its powerful tail swipe attack. This makes the
          Ankylosaurus a favorite among survivors looking to efficiently collect
          resources while minimizing risk.<br />In addition to its
          resource-gathering capabilities, the Ankylosaurus is also a sturdy
          mount that can withstand significant damage in combat situations. Its
          defensive nature and ability to protect itself make it a dependable
          choice for both new and experienced players alike.<br />
